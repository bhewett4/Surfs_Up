# Surfs_Up
Conducting an analyis on weather data for a potential surf shop in Oahu.
## Overview of the Analysis
This analyis is meant to take weather data from both December and June in order to determine if opening a surf shop will be a profitable endeavor based on weather trends. We ran separate queries for the two months and created separate data frames for them, using the describe function in order to display the data frames.
## Results
After conducting the analyis, we found that there was not a large deviation in weather between June and December, with consistent weather, indicating to us that weather year round would be excellent surfing weather. <br/>
